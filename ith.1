.SH NAME
ith \- calculate information theory properties of files
.SH SYNOPSIS
ith [COMMAND] [OPTIONS]
.SH DESCRIPTION
ith builds a Probability Mass Function (PMF) from its input and performs information-theoretic calculations on that PMF.
.SH COMMANDS
.IP -h	
Print usage and exit
.IP -e	
Compute entropy (default if no command specified)
.IP -p	
Print the resulting PMF 
.IP -x	
Run the Pearson chi-squared test against the null hypothesis of uniform distribution over the alphabet
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-a 1 | 8 | 16 | 32 | 64 | char | word | wchar | wword"
Choose the alphabet the input is read over. A number is that number of bits (so, bits, bytes, shorts, ints, and longs, on many platforms). char and wchar are whatever fgetc() and fgetwc() read on your platform. word is a textual word, separated by characters that satisfy isspace() or ispunct(). wword is the wide character analog.
.IP "-f filename"
Read from the specified file. Default is stdin.
.IP "-u 2 | e | 10"
Choose the unit of information for calculation. 2 is bits (this is the default). e is nats (use 
.BR log(3)
rather than 
.BR log2(3)
). 10 is digits (use 
.BR log10(3)
rather than 
.BR log2(3)
).
