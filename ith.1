.SH NAME
ith \- calculate information theory properties of files
.SH SYNOPSIS
ith [COMMAND] [OPTIONS]
.SH DESCRIPTION
ith builds a Probability Mass Function (PMF) from its input and performs information-theoretic calculations on that PMF.
.SH COMMANDS
.IP -h	
Print usage and exit. This overrides any other commands supplied.
.IP -c
Show coverage of alphabet requested (e.g. what percent of all 255 possible bytes are not found in the sample).
.IP -e	
Compute entropy (this is the default if no command is specified).
.IP -k
Compute Kullback-Leibler divergence against a uniform distribution.
.IP -p	
Print the resulting PMF; semantics will vary based on the alphabet chosen below (in particular, 
.B word
will display the string parsed as a word; the rest will display numbers or memory locations since wide char streams make terminals futzy).
.IP -x	
Run the Pearson chi-squared test against the null hypothesis of uniform distribution over the alphabet.
.IP -A
Equivalent to -x -k -e -c.

If more than one command (other than -h) is specified, the output of each will be separated by a newline. 

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-a 1 | 8 | 16 | 32 | 64 | char | word | wchar | wword"
Choose the alphabet by which the input is parsed. A number is that number of bits (so, bits, bytes, shorts, ints, and longs, on many platforms). 
.B char 
and 
.B wchar 
are whatever 
.BR fgetc(3) 
and 
.BR fgetwc(3) 
read on your platform. 
.B word
is a textual word, separated by characters that satisfy 
.BR isspace(3)
or 
.BR ispunct(3)
; 
.B wword 
is the wide character analog. Note that this is a different standard than 
.BR wc(1)
uses to determine word divisions. Note also that your LOCALE will matter if you use
.B wword
or
.B wchar.
.IP "-f filename"
Read from the specified file. Default is stdin.
.IP -t
Be terse; simply print the number rather than a sentence. If multiple commands are specified, -t will apply to all of them. This does not effect the output of the -h or -p commands.
.IP "-u 2 | e | 10"
Choose the unit of information for calculation. 2 is bits (this is the default). e is nats. 10 is digits.
